export2d
========

Blender exporter for animated sprites (2D spritesheets). The sprite can be animated and exported in multiple view-angles (rotations). The python script has a user interface under the "Render" tab in Blender. Currently the script depends on ImageMagick for composition which will probably be replaced at some point.
